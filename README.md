# Harmony

We won first place in the 2015 MIT 6.148 Web Programming Competition! Visit the site [here](icanphysics.herokuapp.com)!

#Intent:
To build a web app that allows users to compose and edit music together in real time. It works more or less like a Google Docs for sheet music composition - try it out!

#Paths:
(for team use)  
So the most confusing stuff will probably be in the `/physics` folder. Important directories/locations of relevant files:

* `physics/app/views/static_pages`		:where some .html files are. Contains `home` (main page), `dashboard` (dashboard).
* `physics/app/views/users`			:where other .html files are. Contains `show` (which is user profile), `index` (list of users).
* `physics/app/assets/stylesheets`		:where ALL your .css/.css.scss files go. Please merge into `style.css.scss` and ensure that class names don't conflict; ignore other files here.
* `physics/app/assets/javascript`		:where ALL your .js files go. Simply move files into this folder and all pages will have access to them.
* `physics/app/assets/images`			:where ALL your images go. Simply move files into this folder and all pages will have access to them, with use of `<%= image_tag "image-name-here.jpg" %>`.

Everything else just talk to Liang about.
